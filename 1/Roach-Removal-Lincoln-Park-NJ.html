<p>Pesticides are chosen and applied in such a way that reduces their possible damage to people, nontarget organisms, and the environment. IPM is most likely to be misconstrued as pest management without chemicals which in truth requirement based usage of chemicals. Pests can be brought into the food processing center through the supply chain, in the active ingredients or product packaging, and the center itself will bring in pests through food smells and lighting.</p>
