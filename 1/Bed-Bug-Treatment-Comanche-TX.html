<p>Without controls on population growth, organisms can quickly attain levels at which damage is caused hence ending up being pests (e.g., locust swarms removing landscapes bare). For example, a rich area likely will have a great deal of large, costly houses, so pest control expenses could be higher there due to the fact that there's more area for a pest control company to cover in among those houses.</p>
