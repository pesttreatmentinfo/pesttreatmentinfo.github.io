<p>Appropriate scouting also supplies information that assist to quantify the advancement of pests and natural enemies. In time, with the glue-board monitoring program and bug submissions, the committee will end up being acquainted with the kinds of pests encountered in the building and the characteristics of the populations.

Trap crops are planted to hold and bring in pest insects where they can be managed more effectively and prevent or reduce their motion onto valuable crops.
