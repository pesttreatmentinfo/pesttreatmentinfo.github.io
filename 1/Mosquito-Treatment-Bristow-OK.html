<p>Correctly identify pests and beneficials on sticky cards and plants. The knowledge of different control alternatives, pest biology and damage capacity, and suitability of readily available resources makes it possible for the grower to decide appropriate for their circumstance. Greenhouses provide an appropriate environment (e.g., temperature level and light) for many biological control representatives or natural opponents including parasitoids, predators, and entomopathogenic nematodes.</p>
<p>Fifty seven of 66 broad spectrum pesticides used on rice at the time were banned by governmental decree (Morse & Buhler 1997).
