Particular biostimulants based upon minerals, microorganisms, plant extracts, seaweed or algae impart induced systemic resistance to pests, diseases, and abiotic stress factors, but are used as modifications without any claims for pest or disease control (Larkin 2008, Vleesschauwer and Höfte 2009, Sharma et al. 2014, López-Bucio et al 2015, Dara 2018a ). These brand-new items or technologies can fall under one or more abovementioned categories of pest management.</p>

<p>Biological control methods can also be seen as natural solutions as they do not rely on the use of pesticides or other chemicals.
