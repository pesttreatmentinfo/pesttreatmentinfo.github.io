To deplore an effective IPM programme, literature and other information sources about the pest, the pest's life cycle, host range, circulation, motion, and standard biology will need to be researched.</p>
<p>Although botanical extracts such as azadirachtin and pyrethrins, and microbe-derived hazardous metabolites such as avermectin and spinosad are regarded as biologicals (Lasota and Dybas 1991, Sarfraz et al. 2005, Dodia et al. 2010 ), they are still chemical particles, comparable to artificial chemicals, and have a number of the environmental and human security risks as chemical pesticides.</p>
