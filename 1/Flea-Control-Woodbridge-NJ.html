Under EPM, chemicals must be used only as a last option, after mechanical, cultural, and biological approaches have been tried and shown ineffective. Different pest control chemicals are poisonous and could be damaging, if not used effectively.</p>
<p>Environmentally safe: Lots of biological control representatives are eco-friendly specialists. Standards and legislation concerning the usage, permitted techniques of application and the storage conditions of pesticides and chemicals vary from country to country, frequently being enacted laws by each state of territory. Research and outreach are an important part of the IPM model to expect and identify pest problems, develop preventive and curative strategies, and effectively disseminate the info through conventional and modern communication tools and strategies.</p>
<p>Using details about pests' biology and practices, along with a toolbox of pest management strategies, pest control employees find, determine, and remove pests. However because these "sex" traps attract primarily male insects, they aren't really reliable controls. This includes mechanical, physical, cultural, biological and chemical control of pest. A regular monitoring program is the basis of IPM decision making, regardless of the control techniques used.</p>
