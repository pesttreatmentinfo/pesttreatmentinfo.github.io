<p>Monitoring and recognition decreases the dangers of using the wrong kind of pesticide, or utilizing pesticides when other strategies will be more efficient. The benefit of the misting pest control approach is that it's considered to be eco-friendly, it's odorless and does not leave any residues that are difficult to be cleaned. Cultural practices - depend on a technique to make the crop or habitat inappropriate to pests by interfering with their oviposition choices, host plant discrimination or area by both immatures and grownups.</p>
