<p>Their expert exterminators are readily available for 24 hr of emergency services for their important customers. Nevertheless, the high potential for reproduction of insect pests stays, and a population explosion of many types can be expected from a low-density level whenever ideal environmental conditions happen or control slackens. Under this scheme, bug control was "supervised" by qualified entomologists, and insecticide applications were based on conclusions reached from periodic monitoring of pest and natural-enemy populations.</p>
