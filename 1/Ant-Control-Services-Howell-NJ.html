<p>Numerous more recent pesticides are originated from plants or naturally happening compounds (e.g.-- pyrethrum, insect and nicotine juvenile hormone analogues), however the toxophore or active component may be altered to provide increased biological activity or stability. Most scientists concur that this will be possible only if we cultivate crops according to the idea of Integrated Pest Management (IPM).</p>
