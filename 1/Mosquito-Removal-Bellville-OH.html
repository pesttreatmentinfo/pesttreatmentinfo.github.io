The complete expression "Integrated Pest Management" (IPM) appeared in press, for the first time, 28 years back (Kogan 1998). It requires a professional technique and strategic attack, which is exactly what you'll get when you enlist aid from Pest Control Services, Inc For instance, by including natural opponents as biological control agents in the management of pests, IPM professionals knew that more particular and less hazardous chemicals would need to be used over the long term (Hoy, 1990; Hull et al., 1997).</p>
<p>Whether you have rodents or regular pests like roaches, spiders, or ants, we will identify the source of the problem.
