<p>You are safe, sure and safe with HICARE's termite pest control services. Insects are infamously tough to control. Pests seek out locations with a plentiful food source, as well as a safe environment in which they can breed. Other fairly low-risk pesticides are offered for some pests.

<p>A specific pest can be managed by certain alternatives, but they might not all be offered in a particular location, for a specific crop, or within the offered financial methods. IPM involves using the very best mix of cultural, chemical and biological procedures for specific situations, including plant biotechnology as proper.

<p>Natural enemies such as predatory arthropods and parasitic wasps can be really efficient in triggering substantial decreases in pest populations in certain scenarios (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ).
