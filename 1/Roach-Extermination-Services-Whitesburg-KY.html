<p>You are safe, sure and safe with HICARE's termite pest control services. Insects are infamously tough to control. Pests seek out locations with a plentiful food source, as well as a safe environment in which they can breed. Other fairly low-risk pesticides are offered for some pests.

<p>Natural enemies such as predatory arthropods and parasitic wasps can be really efficient in triggering substantial decreases in pest populations in certain scenarios (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ).
