<p>Other pesticides, like surface area sprays and termite treatments, remain in the environment for days, weeks or even longer after application. 9 Biological control can be an essential part of an integrated pest management programme.

<p>Utilizing details about pests' biology and routines, in addition to a toolbox of pest management strategies, pest control employees locate, recognize, and remove pests. But due to the fact that these "sex" traps attract mostly male insects, they aren't very reliable controls. This includes mechanical, physical, cultural, chemical and biological control of pest. A routine tracking program is the basis of IPM decision making, regardless of the control strategies utilized.</p>
