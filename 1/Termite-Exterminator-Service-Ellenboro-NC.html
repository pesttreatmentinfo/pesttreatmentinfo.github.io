Crop losses due to illness, arthropods, and weeds, though contested by some as a valid procedure, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) regardless of the surge of pest control.</p>
<p>For example, rodents threaten grain yields, birds and snails damage strawberries, potato beetles attack potatoes, eggplants, and tomatoes. In addition to pest control, we also use incorporated plans to help secure the entire house, including insulation and moisture control services.
