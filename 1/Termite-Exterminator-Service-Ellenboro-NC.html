Crop losses due to illness, arthropods, and weeds, though contested by some as a valid procedure, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) regardless of the surge of pest control.</p>
<p>For example, rodents threaten grain yields, birds and snails damage strawberries, potato beetles attack potatoes, eggplants, and tomatoes.
