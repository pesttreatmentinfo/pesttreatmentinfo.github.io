<p>Mechanical and physical controls kill a pest directly, block pests out, or make the environment unsuitable for it. Traps for rodents are examples of mechanical control.

<p>Stay vigilant and call your pest control expert for a follow-up treatment if you ever see pests returning after treatment. Modern crop varieties frequently accidentally produce conditions which prefer pest types (e.g., pest species which have actually bored deeper into larger fruit making them unattainable to natural opponents). Expect SARS-CoV-2 to behave like an intrusive species presented to a new location when resources are plentiful (that is, individuals without immunity) and there are no biological controls to keep the population in check or registered items to utilize in management (such as federally authorized medications).</p>
