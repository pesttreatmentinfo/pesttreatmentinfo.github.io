The four significant problems experienced with standard pesticides are toxic residues, pest resistance, secondary pests, and pest renewal. Integrated pest management (IPM) is a strategy that prevents pest damage with minimum negative influence on human health, the environment and non-target organisms.</p>
<p>The best method to control pests is to make your house unattractive to them. But home pests can also be a danger to your family.

Biological control is much easier to implement in a monoculture (single crop) than in a polyculture (several crops).</p>
<p>Farmers and growers have actually been regularly using a lot of these IPM methods for years and even generations - techniques such as crop rotation, not planting crops in locations prone to pests, or utilizing tolerant or resistant varieties.
