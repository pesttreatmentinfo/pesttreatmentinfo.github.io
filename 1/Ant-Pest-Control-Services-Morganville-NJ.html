The four significant problems experienced with standard pesticides are toxic residues, pest resistance, secondary pests, and pest renewal. Integrated pest management (IPM) is a strategy that prevents pest damage with minimum negative influence on human health, the environment and non-target organisms.</p>
<p>The best method to control pests is to make your house unattractive to them. But home pests can also be a danger to your family.

Biological control is much easier to implement in a monoculture (single crop) than in a polyculture (several crops).</p>
