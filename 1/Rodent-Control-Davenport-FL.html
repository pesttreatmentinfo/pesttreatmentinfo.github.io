Ex: Fumigation, Baits and traps, Repellants, General pest control technique, Heat treatment, Bug Development Regulators, Disinfectants, Herbicides. Truly acceptable solutions to pest problems will require a shift to understanding and promoting naturally taking place biological representatives and other fundamental strengths as elements of overall farming ecosystems and designing our cropping systems so that these natural forces keep the pests within appropriate bounds.</p>
<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and some of the pesticides utilized in a natural system are as hazardous to humans and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control professionals can only do so much to secure the food supply," says Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The reality is, food business operators need to take an active function in integrated pest management by working carefully with the professionals.</p>
