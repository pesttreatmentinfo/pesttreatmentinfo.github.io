<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program is a reliable and ecologically delicate  technique to pest control. These might or might not include products listed on the Organic Products Review Institute (OMRI) 15 Although the pesticides and especially insecticides used in natural farming and natural gardening are normally more secure than synthetic pesticides, they are not constantly more environmentally friendly or safe than synthetic pesticides and can cause damage.</p>
<p>IPM is the holistic use of all available plant security approaches and subsequent integration of appropriate procedures to dissuade the development of weed, pest and illness populations.
