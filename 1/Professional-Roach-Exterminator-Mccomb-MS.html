<p>This approach of pest control has fallen out of favour in recent years because fire eliminates advantageous insects along with the pests and can have an unfavorable influence on the soil. To minimize possible harm to beneficial insects, restrict your spraying to small areas where you can see pests hiding, and leave a couple of unsprayed "refuges" for any good bugs you can't see.</p>
