Peninsular Pest Control, the Animal Gitter", has been providing pest control and lawn fertilization services to North Florida homes, organisations and hospitals given that 1954.

<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural enemies and dissuade pest perseverance consist of intercropping (numerous crops in the very same field) to make it harder for pests to discover a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests far from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to coincide with times where pests have actually emerged and died off for the season.</p>
