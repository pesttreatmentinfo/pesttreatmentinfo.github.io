<p>With IPM you'll use the most selective pesticide that will get the job done and be the most safe for other organisms and for air, water, and soil quality; use pesticides in bait stations rather than sprays; or spot-spray a couple of weeds rather of a whole location. Due to any variety of factors, including those discussed in the Chemical and Cultural areas, jeopardizing the efficiency of natural enemies often enables potential pest organisms to experience practically uncontrolled population development and allows them to reach pest status.</p>
<p>Keeping an eye on ways inspecting your field, structure, landscape, or forest-- or other site-- to determine which pests are present, how many there are, or what damage they've triggered. Selecting plants adapted to our climate is the first step to prevent issues with pests, weeds, or disease.
