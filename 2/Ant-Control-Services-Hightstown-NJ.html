<p>WebMD veterinary professionals answer frequently asked questions about fleas and ticks on your pet dog. Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to bring in and vacuum the western ruined plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been advised as an IPM tactic by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the concept did not take off since growers were not all set for such an intercropping plan. If your center presently uses an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you won't be surprised to hear that the pest control market has and will continue to approach least-impact products and services.</p>
<p>IPM techniques include both chemical and nonchemical means to avoid and control pest populations from reaching financially damaging levels.
