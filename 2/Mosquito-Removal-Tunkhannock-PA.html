<p>A typical pitfall most organisations encounter is explaining their business name too literally by using tired pest control terms like control, management, pesticide, and insecticide. The pest management industry is large, with over 15,000 companies serving the general public and around 150,000 pest control service workers. Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, bedbugs, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow coats, bees and flies are commonly found pests in our society.</p>
