<p>The number of plants inspected will depend upon factors such as the value of the crop, prospective problems and size and type of greenhouses. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) combines different types of controls-- from hands-on pest removal to traditional synthetic pesticides-- in a sensible, long-lasting strategy. Biopesticides are normally compatible with natural opponents, however there are exceptions.</p>
<p>Likewise, think about how the variety of plants to be grown in the same area might influence ease of pesticide applications and spread of disease. Pest control pertains to non-lethal methods too, such as keeping the location tidy and complimentary of any food particles or other attractants, sealing up entry ways such as cracks in walls or the area between the bottom of the floor and a door.</p>
