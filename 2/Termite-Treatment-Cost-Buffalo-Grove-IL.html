<p>Socio-psychological aspects including moral and reasonable factors to consider were found to the drivers in IPM application in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka revealed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or illness occurrence and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey performed by Parsa et al. (2014) also revealed that a lack of certified IPM experts and extension educators was an obstacle for IPM implementation in industrialized nations.</p>
<p>Recent studies document the requirement for ongoing decreases in dangerous pesticide usage and practices. Although the standard elements of IPM are constantly the same, the specific components of an IPM program vary from one environment or circumstance to another. When done before spacing the plants, application of predatory mites against thrips in potted plants is more effective.</p>
<p>There are several pest control companies situated all over the city, that is why, is necessary to know which one is the very best in order to avoid being cheated by any mediocre company. Household pests can consist of insects such as mosquitoes, cockroaches and flies, or rodents like mice or rats. I have tried numerous pest control suppliers consisting of well recognized nationwide level brand names in the business, however have never come across anyone who shows this degree of expert insight and technique.</p>
<p>Some of these are: neem spray, prepared from neem kernels (Azadirachta indica) extract, effective versus sucking pests, jassids, bollworms and thrips; pyrethrum, prepared from powdered flower heads or liquid extracts of chrysanthemum, reliable against red cotton bug, cutworms, grasshoppers; botanical mixes, combinations of extracts from different plants such as castor, thorn apple, lantana, custard apple, sweet potato leaves, tomato leaves, ginger, chilly, gliricidia, marigold, etc</p>
