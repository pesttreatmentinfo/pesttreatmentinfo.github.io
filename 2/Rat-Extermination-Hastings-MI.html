<p>Monitoring and identification lowers the dangers of utilizing the incorrect kind of pesticide, or using pesticides when other techniques will be more efficient.

Cultural practices - depend on a method to make the crop or environment undesirable to pests by interfering with their oviposition choices, host plant discrimination or place by both immatures and adults.</p>
