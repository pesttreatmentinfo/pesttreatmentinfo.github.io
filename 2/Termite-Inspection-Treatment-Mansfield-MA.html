<p>Pest management needs a holistic technique to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are used only after routine monitoring suggests that a pest population had reached an economic threshold level. Numerous specific commodity growers, for such crop as strawberries and potatoes, are working to specify what IPM implies for their crop and region, and IPM-labeled foods are offered in minimal locations.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that of their potential damage to pest control workers, clients, and the environment, restricted-use pesticides are greatly managed by Federal law. Fungus: Beauveria bassiana is used for control of lepidopterous pests. The interactions between crop and pest (in addition to the environment) are extremely important. Promo of natural enemies: Not using pesticides and diversifying crops benefits natural enemies of cotton pests such as birds, ladybirds, beetles, spiders, parasitic wasps, bugs and ants.</p>

Integrated pest management (IPM) is a term utilized to describe a methodical technique of managing pests using non-chemical pest management methods and the judicious use of pesticides when pest populations surpass appropriate levels.</p>
