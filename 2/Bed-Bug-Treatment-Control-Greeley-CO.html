<p>At Aegis Pest Control we are dedicated to providing the very best possible service to secure against unwanted pests. The following example explains the six parts of an Integrated Pest Management program utilized to handle carpenter ants. Focusing primarily on long-term pest prevention, a successful IPM program utilizes a combination of control methods including biological control, habitat adjustment, modifications to cultural practices and usage of resistant plant ranges.</p>
<p>In reference to the principle of integrating using other and biological controls in complementary methods, the term was later widened to embrace collaborated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have actually been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to have greater levels of resistance.</p>
