<p>The full expression "Integrated Pest Management" (IPM) appeared in press, for the very first time, 28 years ago (Kogan 1998).

<p>A specific pest can be managed by certain alternatives, but they might not all be readily available in a specific place, for a particular crop, or within the available monetary methods.

This preparation includes attention to field histories to anticipate what the pest issues might be, choosing crop varieties which are resistant or tolerant to pest damage, choosing tillage systems that will suppress anticipated pest damage while giving the crop the best yield potential.</p>
<p>Pesticides are picked and applied in a way that lessens their possible harm to people, nontarget organisms, and the environment.
