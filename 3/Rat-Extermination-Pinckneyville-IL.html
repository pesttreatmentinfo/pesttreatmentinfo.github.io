With its success in many parts of the world, IPM is viewed as a cost-efficient and ecologically benign pest control strategy ideally matched for both little and large farmers around the world. When termites have gotten in a structure, they do not restrict themselves to wood; they also damage paper, fabric, carpets and more.

With IPM, you take actions to keep pests from becoming an issue, such as by growing a healthy crop that can stand up to pest attacks, utilizing disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from entering a structure. Recent missions for efficient, safe, and lasting pest management programs have been targeted primarily toward advancement of new and better products with which to replace conventional harmful pesticides.</p>
