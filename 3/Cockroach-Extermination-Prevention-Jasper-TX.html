Almost every kind of pest positions a hazard to the residential or commercial properties they occupy, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards.

<p>Kaolin particle films used in natural farming might control some pests, but can negatively impact natural opponents and cause other pests to proliferate (Markó et al. 2008 ). Organic farming practices might encourage natural opponent populations, but a higher variety of natural opponents does not constantly lead to pest suppression (Dara 2014 ). Mechanical pest control practices such as vacuuming or tilling use nonrenewable fuel sources and indirectly have a negative effect on the environment.</p>
