<p>Socio-psychological aspects including moral and reasonable factors to consider were found to the drivers in IPM implementation in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka showed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or disease incident and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ).
