<p>The most efficient technique for managing pests is to combine techniques in an approach referred to as Integrated Pest Management (IPM). IPM is an alternative method to making use of pesticides.

<p>IPM programs work to monitor for pests and recognize them precisely, so that proper control choices can be made in conjunction with action thresholds.
