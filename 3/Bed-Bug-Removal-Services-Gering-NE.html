<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and a few of the pesticides used in a natural system are as harmful to people and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control experts can just do so much to protect the food supply," says Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The fact is, food business operators need to take an active role in integrated pest management by working closely with the experts.</p>
<p>Continuous surveillance and monitoring of insect pests population is important for evaluation of damage and for determining the needs for actions to be taken. Chemical pest control is making use of pesticides to damage harmful insects ororganisms. Recent issue for pollinator health has also resulted in constraints on using specific pesticides. To prevent plant damage, do not spray any plants experiencing moisture stress.</p>
<p>They are chosen and applied in a way that avoids interrupting other IPM practices if pesticides are necessary. Nearly every kind of pest presents a hazard to the properties they occupy, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the execution of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or strongly defined Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outdoor environment.</p>
<p>A method that includes using pest-tolerant and pest-resistant cultivars developed through traditional breeding or genetic engineering (Douglas 2018, Kennedy 2008, Nelson et al. 2018 ). These cultivars possess physical, morphological, or biochemical characters that reduce the plant's beauty or viability for the pest to feed, develop, or reproduce successfully.</p>
