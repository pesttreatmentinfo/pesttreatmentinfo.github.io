Nevertheless, the high potential for recreation of insect pests stays, and a population surge of lots of types can be anticipated from a low-density level whenever suitable ecological conditions happen or control slackens. Under this plan, bug control was "supervised" by qualified entomologists, and insecticide applications were based on conclusions reached from regular tracking of pest and natural-enemy populations.</p>
