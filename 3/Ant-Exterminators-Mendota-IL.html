<p>Biological control has been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To resolve intrusive pest concerns, classical biological control approach is usually utilized where natural opponents from the native region of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control technique that has been effectively used versus a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
