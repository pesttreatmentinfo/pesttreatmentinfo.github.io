<p>In recommendation to the idea of incorporating the use of biological and other controls in complementary ways, the term was later on expanded to embrace coordinated usage of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural opponents are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have actually been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to possess greater levels of resistance.</p>
<p>Biological control has been effectively utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To resolve invasive pest issues, classical biological control method is typically used where natural opponents from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and released in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control method that has been successfully utilized against a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
