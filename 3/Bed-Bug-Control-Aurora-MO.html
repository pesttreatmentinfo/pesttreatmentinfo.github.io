The pest management industry is large, with over 15,000 companies serving the public and around 150,000 pest control service workers. Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, vermins, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow jackets, bees and flies are commonly found pests in our society.</p>
<p>In contrast, insecticides that are more selective because they are most effective versus insects with particular feeding routines, at particular life stages, or within specific taxonomic groups, are described as "biorational" pesticides. Established in 1967, it is the leading association of the professional pest management markets, with over 350 members throughout the nation.</p>
