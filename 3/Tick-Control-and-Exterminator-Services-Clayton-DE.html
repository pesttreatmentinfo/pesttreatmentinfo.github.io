Natural enemy abundance and biological control are significantly enhanced in Bt crops when compared to insecticide-treated standard fields. Learning about the pests you have and choices that are available to control specific pests is the initial step.</p>

We hire exterminators who specialize in business or commercial pest control. Constant training and education of farmers represent the cornerstone for facility of solid and efficient IPM program in agroecosystems.</p>
