<p>When you discover the very first pests in your trap, you know it's time to release your control strategies, such as putting your row covers in position and applying Bacillus thuringiensis. For professional pest control companies, pest control doesn't end with treatment. Our Phoenix pest control group is trained to take care of all your Arizona pests. In this very first short video of the series, Dr. Harrison walks you through best strategies and practices to help avoid pests and the diseases they carry from affecting your patients, staff and bottom line.</p>
<p>The approach to be selected for IPM depends on lots of aspects, the essential of which are nature of target pest, the environment, and economic aspect of the management. Insect pests trigger significant losses to food and fiber crops worldwide. If basic house hygiene is neglected, the effects of other types of pest control will be incredibly short-lived as the pests will soon be back, and in higher numbers.</p>
<p>IPCA highly advises hiring qualified and knowledgeable pest control specialists from IPCA Member organisations across the country. Agriculture tackles the concern with integrated pest management. The term pest" refers to more than one cause of problems consisting of diseases, undesirable insects, mites, weeds, mollusks and nematodes.

<p>In contrast, natural food production uses a lot of the same concepts as IPM but limits using pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than artificial chemicals. Other claims include reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to decrease the need for other, less ecologically beneficial, herbicides.</p>
