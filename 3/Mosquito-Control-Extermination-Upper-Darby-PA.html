<p>Socio-psychological factors consisting of ethical and logical factors to consider were found to the drivers in IPM application in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka revealed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or illness occurrence and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A study conducted by Parsa et al. (2014) likewise revealed that a lack of certified IPM specialists and extension teachers was an obstacle for IPM implementation in developed countries.</p>
<p>These unidentified or inadequately understood possible risks argue for additional levels of security including direct exposures to several pesticides, at home, at school and in the diet plan; direct exposure to chemicals in combination with pesticides such as pharmaceuticals, industrial compounds and individual care products; and the basic problem in attributing chronic illnesses to any one specific cause.</p>
<p>Biological control approaches can also be seen as natural solutions as they do not depend on the use of pesticides or other chemicals. Pest control is essential since rodents and insects bring diseases, infest your kitchen areas and bed rooms, and bite you or your pets. Use indicator plants to identify the effectiveness of pest management techniques and to monitor prone crops for the infections (tospoviruses) such as impatiens necrotic area infection (INSV) and tomato found wilt virus (TSWV).</p>
