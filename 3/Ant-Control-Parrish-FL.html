<p>The approach to be chosen for IPM depends on numerous elements, the crucial of which are nature of target pest, the environment, and financial element of the management. Insect pests trigger considerable losses to food and fiber crops worldwide.

<p>Pesticides are picked and applied in a manner that lessens their possible harm to individuals, nontarget organisms, and the environment. IPM is probably to be misinterpreted as pest management without chemicals which in truth need based usage of chemicals.
